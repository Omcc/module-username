# Diglin\Username module for Magento 2 #

Magento module which allows your customers to use a username and not only the email address as identifier

**IMPORTANT**
It's a BETA. Lots of things have not been yet implemented or is a work in progress. For example checkout login doesn't work.

## Features

TODO
